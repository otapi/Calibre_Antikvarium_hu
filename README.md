I must give credits to the original author, Daermond for making and publishing the initial plugin, but sadly he had abandoned it, so here I am taking over and fixing the errors that have popped up since.

Also, a big thumbs up for kiwidude, for sorting things out for me. 

## Main features:
Can retrieve title, author, series, ISBN, comments, tags, publisher, year of publication, rating, language and a cover image
Shows multiple results if possible (3 by default, can be 1-20)
Search based on ISBN if present, otherwise based on title and/or author

## Special Notes:
Requires Calibre 0.8 or later. Tested with 3.2.0.0

## Installation Notes:
Download the attached zip file and install the plugin as described in the Introduction to plugins thread.
Note that this is not a GUI plugin so it is not intended/cannot be added to context menus/toolbars etc.
